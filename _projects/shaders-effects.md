Here I present some of my general work in the field of real-time 3D rendering, with a focus on shader development and real-time 3D applications.

### Relief-Mapping Shader (Unity)  

During my academic studies at [UFRGS](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en), I was fortunate enough to study under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Manuel Menezes de Oliveira Neto](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/), responsible for the development of the [Relief Mapping](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/RTM.html) technique. Here are some of my implementations of the technique in Unity:

### Kuwahara Filter Shader (UE5)  

During an in-house game jam at [Double Dash Studios](http://www.doubledashstudios.com), I developed a Kuwahara Filter shader. The objective was to provide a painterly effect, which we used mainly to test out the game's visuals during early development. Here's a video showcasing the effect:

### Virtual-Reality Applications  

At the start of my career, I used to developed Virtual-Reality applications for the Oculus Rift and mobile devices, which required heavy graphics optimization to provide stable runtime performance.
