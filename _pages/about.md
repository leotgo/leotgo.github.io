My academic background at [UFRGS](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en) was heavily focused on real-time 3D rendering, which contributed to my professional interest in Game Engines and High-Performance software development.

I specialize in C++ and C# for RT3D applications. Substantial experience with Unity, UE4/5, OpenGL and Vulkan.
